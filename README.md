# Modified Hyperion case for SlimeVR with PCB for BMI160 IMU

This is a modified version Hyperion case made to fit a custom made PCB that holds standard SlimeVR components and a BMI160 IMU. <br>
The original design of the case is made by Smeltie and can be found here: https://github.com/Smeltie/Hyperion
The 804040 battery variant of the case is made by Discord user 'Tamate Momochi#9595'

## Components
This Case/PCB is made for the standard DIY SlimeVR components that are recommended in the docs. you can check the docs for links to the specific componets here: https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html <br>
Only difference is to the docs the switch used, which is smaller and looks nicer (standard for the hyperion case) <br>
The IMU used is the BMI160. <br>

- TP4056
- Wemos D1 Mini
- BMI160
